			  <ul class="ul_list">
				  <li><a href="https://krita.org" target="_blank">Krita</a> - "a professional FREE and open source painting program". This is what <em> I </em> use for drawing digitally. Very nice selection of brushes. </li>
				  <li><a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a> - Often hailed as <em>The</em> Free & Open Source Image Editor, as the site itself states. My hatred and frustrations directed at program cannot be understated, but it deserves a place here nonetheless.</li>
				  <li><a href="https://www.photopea.com/" target="_blank">Photopea</a> - One of the best-known alternatives to Photoshop, only getting more and more popular as Adobe dives deeper and deeper into anti-consumer practices with each year passing. </li>
				  <li><a href="https://www.aseprite.org/" target="_blank">Aseprite</a> - Probably the best-known program for drawing pixel art; nothing else that I know of can match it. Not free, but it <em>is</em> open-source! You just have to compile it yourself.</li>
				  <li><a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> - The only vector graphics program on this list, mainly because I've never had the need for any vector graphics.</li>

				  <h3>As far as I'm concerned, <em>there is only one</em> free (and open-source!) program that can stand anywhere in the viscinity of industry standard giants like Maya, Autodesk, and Adobe. Meet the myth, the legend, the creation of hundreds of contributors... </h3>
			  <ul class="ul_list">
				  <li><a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a> - <em>nothing else compares.</em> </li>
			  </ul>
			  <h3>That being said, Blender lacks a little in the texturing department. It's <em>acceptable</em>, but one might have to look elsewhere for textures...</h3>

					  <li><a href="https://ambientcg.com/" target="_blank">ambientCG</a> - Quite a small website, but all these assets are also under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/" target="_blank">CC0</a>. Donate if you can! </li>
					  <li><a href="https://textures.figglewatts.co.uk/" target="_blank">Open Texture Library?</a> - An even smaller site, born after textures.com got too greedy in early 2024. <em>They</em> don't even deserve a hyperlink.</li>
					  <li><a href="https://www.cgbookcase.com/textures/" target="_blank">CG Bookcase</a> - another small site. I like all the variations on similiar textures.</li>

			  <h1> Section 1: AUDIO </h1>
			  <div class="subsection">
				  <h2>People often forget about audio. Music is <em>the</em> best way to make someone feel something, and sound effect are <em>essential</em> for better interactivity. USE THEM!</h2>

				  <h2>Music creation - nowadays plenty of people use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation" target="_blank">DAWs.</a></h2>
				  <p>I think this section requires some clarification. There are <em>many</em> DAWs out there, but what works best for <em>you</em> may not work for others. <a href="https://www.image-line.com/" target="_blank">FLStudio</a> seems to be the industry standard, but <em>it is not a requirement to get into music creation</em>. Honestly, just pick something and try it out! You will never get anywhere if you're stuck trying to pick "the best" program. <a href="https://twitter.com/villecallio/status/1807142505520955585" target="_blank">As Ville Kallio so eloquently put it...</a></p>

				  <h2>Sound creation</h2>
				  <p>Sometimes it's best to create the sounds you need <em>yourself</em>. You can just record yourself banging some pans together, eating an apple, or you can make the sound with your throat. But sometimes you need a program to make sounds for you.</p>
				  <ul class="ul_list">
					  <li><a href="https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone" target="_blank">Chiptone</a> - The most sophisticated, evolved program on this sublist. Nice UI, plenty of control over the sound.</li>
					  <li><a href="https://www.bfxr.net/" target="_blank">Bfxr</a> - One of the programs Chiptone is based on.</li>
					  <li><a href="http://drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html" target="_blank">sfxr</a> - The grandfather of many sound-making programs, including the ones listed above.</li>
			  	  </ul>
			  </div>
			  <div class="subsection">
				  <h2>Ready-made sounds and music</h2>
				  <p>But audio can be a lot of work. Why not rely on other people sometimes?</p>
				  <ul class="ul_list">
					  <li><a href="https://freesound.org/" target="_blank">FreeSound.org</a> - A large sound library, which anyone may contribute to, Make sure to check each sound's specific license before use!</li>

					  <li><a href="https://www.steven-obrien.net/" target="_blank">Steven O'Brien</a> - not quite as notorious as Kevin MacLeod, but he's made plenty of music.</li>
					  <li><a href="https://musopen.org/music/" target="_blank">MUSOPEN</a> - a library of royalty free renditions of well-known classical pieces. Very useful, many performances you can find online are copyrighted.</li>
					  <li><a href="https://freemusicarchive.org/home" target="_blank">Free Music Archive</a> - Another big archive. Check each piece's license before you use it!</li>
